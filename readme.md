# ðŸ˜‚ Welcome to the GPT Exploration Extravaganza! ðŸ˜‚

## Description

Welcome to the wild world of GPT exploration, where we dive into the fascinating (and slightly confusing) universe of generative pre-trained transformers (yes this is the name under GPT)! 

## Install

Installing this project is easier than understanding quantum physics (or GPT, for that matter). Just follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo: 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TheRealMarVin/gp2.git
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the project directory: 

    ```bash
    cd gpt2
    ```
    
3. Install the necessary dependencies (pro tip: use a virtual environment so you don't accidentally break the space-time continuum):

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   You will also need to install the latest PyTorch version
